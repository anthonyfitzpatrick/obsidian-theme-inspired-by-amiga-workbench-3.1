## What this is

Workbench 3.1 is the mature form. Visually it inherits the 1990 redesign almost
unchanged — the same raised gadgets, the same recessed fields, the same square geometry —
because there was no second redesign. What changed underneath was colour depth. On the
AGA machines, an A1200 or an A4000, Workbench came up in **eight colours rather than
four**, and the four it added were a mid grey, a light grey, a warm beige and a salmon
pink.

Those extras are the reason a 3.1 desktop is remembered as warmer than a 2.04 one. They
were used for icon shading and drawer artwork, and they gave the whole environment a
softer cast that the strict four-colour 2.0 palette could not produce. This theme leans
on exactly that: the greys are tinted toward the beige, the pictograms are drawn in it,
and the salmon serves as the interactive accent.

The relief is 2.04's, with one refinement the later style guide did bring — a mid-tone
step inside the window frame, and more generous spacing around controls. It is the most
comfortable of the three to sit in front of for a long stretch.

</p>

<p align="center"><em>The same workspace in dark mode. The warm cast is carried through rather than dropped — the dark greys stay tinted, which is precisely what separates 3.1's dark mode from 2.04's cool neutral.</em></p>

## Why you might choose this one

**Pick 3.1 when you want the classic Workbench look at its most comfortable.** It has
the same dimensional gadgets as 2.04 but more room around them, and the warm greys are
easier on the eye over a long session than 2.04's cool neutral. Historically 2.04 and 3.1
looked very alike — this theme separates them the way the era actually did, by
temperature and colour depth rather than by inventing differences that never existed.

## The palette

Every colour below is stated plainly so you can see exactly what the theme does. Nothing
is hidden behind a gradient or an image.

| Role | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Screen | `#9b948e` | A warm grey desktop, tinted toward the eight-colour beige |
| Windows | `#aea6a0` | Warm light-grey working surfaces |
| Panels | `#a59d97` | Explorer and sidebars |
| Title bars | `#3b67a2` | A cleaner, more saturated blue than 2.04's |
| Accent | `#ffa997` | The eight-colour salmon. Disclosure arrows, active gadgets, focus in dark mode |
| Pictograms | `#aa907c` | The eight-colour beige, as the drawer artwork used it |

## The geometry

| Property | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Relief | 2px, full, plus a frame step | 3.x kept 2.0's gadget and refined the frame |
| Border width | 2px bevels with a mid-tone inner step | The window frame gains a third layer |
| Corner radius | 0 | Square throughout |
| Spacing unit | 0.5rem | The most generous of the three |
| Control height | 2.125rem | The largest gadgets |

</p>

<p align="center"><em>The ribbon and the file tree at depth. The connector rails and disclosure triangles are drawn in salmon, the clearest single difference from 2.04, which draws the identical structure in grey. The ribbon pictograms are original drawings, not Obsidian's default line icons.</em></p>

## What is covered

The theme styles the whole application, not just the editor:

- **Workspace shell** — ribbon, tab bar, view headers, status bar, pane dividers
- **File explorer** — indentation, disclosure triangles, connector rails, selection
- **Editor and reading view** — headings, lists, links, code, tables, callouts, quotes
- **Properties** — rebuilt as a Workbench-style requester with a keyed column
- **Command palette and quick switcher** — recessed entry field, square result rows,
  keyboard hints drawn as small raised gadgets
- **Menus, modals, notices and tooltips** — hard frames, title strips, solid selection
- **Canvas, graph, Bases and backlinks** — consistent surface and control treatment
- **Settings** — including when opened in its own window

</p>

<p align="center"><em>The tab strip, the breadcrumb path and the toolbar row beneath them. 3.1 keeps 2.04's 2px gadget relief and adds the later style guide's refinement — a mid-tone step inside the window frame, and more room around every control.</em></p>

## Installation

### From Obsidian's Community Themes browser

1. Open **Settings → Appearance**.
2. Under **Themes**, choose **Manage**.
3. Search for **Amiga Workbench 3.1**.
4. Select it and choose **Use**.

### Manually

1. Download `theme.css` and `manifest.json` from this repository.
2. Place both in `YourVault/.obsidian/themes/Modern Amiga Workbench 3.1 inspired/` — the folder name must match exactly.
3. In Obsidian, go to **Settings → Appearance → Themes** and select **Amiga Workbench 3.1**.
4. If it does not appear, close and reopen Obsidian.

## Light and dark

Both modes are designed, not generated. Switch with **Settings → Appearance → Base theme**.
No plugin is involved.

Dark mode carries the blue title hierarchy and the warm accents onto a warm-tinted
dark screen, keeping it distinct from 2.04's neutral charcoal.

## Fonts

The theme follows *your* typography settings. Set **Settings → Appearance → Interface font,
Text font, Monospace font** and **Font size**, and the entire interface follows — including
the tab bar, view headers, file explorer and status bar.

Leave them unset and the theme's own stack applies. It never overrides a font you have
chosen.

## Requirements

- Obsidian **1.6.0** or later
- No plugins. The theme is plain CSS and works on its own.

## Accessibility

- Every text and background pair is contrast-checked in both light and dark modes
- Keyboard focus is always visible, with a dedicated focus colour
- `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected
- `prefers-contrast: more` strengthens frames and removes muted text
- Printing and PDF export drop the screen palette for black on white

  troubleshooting

## Building from source

This repository is self-contained. The CSS is authored as modules under `src/` and
`theme.css` is generated from them:

```sh
npm run build    # regenerate theme.css from src/
npm test         # verify packaging, isolation, tokens and contrast
```

There are no dependencies to install — the build is plain Node. `src/variants/` holds this
theme's light and dark palettes; `src/components/workbench-chrome.css` holds the shared
Workbench structure; `src/icons/` holds the ribbon pictograms, which are coloured from the
palette at build time so they can never drift from it.

`theme.css` is generated. Edit the modules under `src/` and rebuild rather than editing it
directly; the pre-commit hook enforces this if you enable it with
`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.

### Why the name refers to Workbench at all

The name is **descriptive, not proprietary**. It tells you which remembered look the
palette and proportions are drawn from — the mature Workbench of 1992–94 — in the same way a paint colour might be
called "racing green" without any claim on a car manufacturer. This is nominative use:
naming a thing in order to describe a resemblance to it. It is not a claim of origin,
authorship or authority.

The project's own framing is **"Amiga Inspired"**. Inspired by. Not a port, not a
recreation, not a replica, not a continuation, and not a substitute for anything real.

### No original assets are used or distributed

- Topaz or any other Amiga bitmap font, or any digitisation of one
- Original wallpapers, backdrops, pointers, brand marks or logos
- Screenshots of any Amiga system, used as an asset or otherwise

Every graphic in this theme is an **original drawing**, authored for this project as
inline SVG, using ordinary geometry. Colour values are stated as plain numbers. Colours
themselves are not copyrightable, and no artwork has been copied.
